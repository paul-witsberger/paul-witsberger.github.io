                <p>FFNNs are neural networks that have connections from the inputs forward through the network to the outputs, with no feedback connections.</p>

            <h3 id="ne">NeuroEvolution</h3>
            <p>Neuroevolution (NE) involves using an evolutionary algorithm to train a neural network. Evolutionary algorithms are heuristic search algorithms inspired by physical phenomena which can be used to perform optimization on difficult numerical problems. In this case, I have used a genetic algorithm, although other similar global optimization methods include particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, among others.</p>

                <h4 id="genetic algorithm">Genetic Algorithms (GA)</h4>
                <p>Genetic algorithms are inspired by the principle of biological evolution, where there are successive generations of increasingly competitive individuals based on natural selection and random mutations.</p>

            <h3 id="neat">NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)</h3>
            <p>NEAT takes the principle of NE farther by including the topology of the neural network as optimization variables in addition to the weights of the neural network. By including the network topology (that is, the hidden neurons and their connections) in the optimization, the neural network can grow to become more complex over the course of optimization.</p>
